INUIT: The Interface Usability Instrument
=========================================

## Abstract

There are numerous instruments for measuring usability on the web. Surprisingly, none aims at live usability testing of online webpages, which is more cost-effective and less time-consuming compared to common approaches. Based on guideline reviews and expert interviews, we propose INUIT--a new usability instrument aimed at this specific purpose. A confirmatory factor analysis shows that the structure of INUIT well reflects users’ perception of web interface usability. Results also indicate that we can correlate client-side interaction patterns with INUIT’s usability factors, which is an important step towards prediction of usability from implicit data alone.
